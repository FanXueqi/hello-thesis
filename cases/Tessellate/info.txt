Intro:“Hoberman designed a dynamic installation for the Stony Brook Foundation’s new Center for Geometry and Physics.
Serving as both the building's artistic centerpiece and as a functional piece of shading, the installation is a floor-to-ceiling composition of Adaptive Building Initiative's Tessellate panels. Hoberman designed each panel to have a unique geometric pattern of perforations that mirrors the research focus of the building's resident scientists and mathematicians. As these patterns align and diverge, the visual effect is of sparse geometric patterns  hexagons, circles, squares, and triangles that blossom into an opaque mesh. The result is a kinetic surface that spans 38 square meters and imbues the building with the functional capacity to dynamically change its opacity and sculpt the quality of light within.”
