Intro:Yeosu’s climate is characterized by three main seasons: a cool winter, a hot and humid summer, and moderate intermediate periods. The building’s ocean-facing facade, which integrates moving lamellas, is able to capture and guide the wind through the building during moderate and non-humid seasons, thus enhances the natural ventilation. (Transsolar) The kinetic facade was inspired by a research project at the ITKE University Stuttgart which investigates how biological moving mechanism can be applied in an architectural scale.
