Title:Refurbishment High-Rise Sparkasse
Architects:SAI 
Time:Built in 1969, renovated in 2011
Location:Rosenheim, Germany
Shading Material: 
Frame Material: 
Keywords:wind, natural ventilation 
Challenges:mitigating High Winds - pressure reduction facade for nature ventilation
Intro:“Research, expert opinions, model calculations, simulations, and cost analyses were able to prove that the redevelopment of the 40 years old high-rise building would be the most reasonable measure from an ecological and economical point of view and would also generate a high surface yield. “(STG)|“The intelligent combination of the double facade system with the cooling, heating, and ventilation systems reduces the energy costs to a fraction of the original value.”(STG)|The double facade create a climate buffer to reduce wind pressure and allows natural ventilation of the office spaces.|
