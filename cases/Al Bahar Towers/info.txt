Intro: “A key driver in the design was a more natural view from the building and minimizing the use of artificial light.” —Giorgio Buffoni, associate on Arup’s London facade engineering team.|“It is an adaptive building—the shape and performance react according to the environment,” says Giorgio Buffoni, an associate in the London facade engineering team at Arup.|In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), 70% to 85% of the solar gain in typical towers is due to direct exposure to solar rays. (Abdulmajid Karanouha and Ethan Kerberb, 2015) The biggest challenge of the design team is to improve internal comfort and reduce energy use. Compared with other skyscrapers in the region, whose glazing are always heavily tinted or highly reflective, the facade of Al Bahar Towers allowing more natural view and minimizing the use of artificial light.
