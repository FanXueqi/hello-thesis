Intro:The corners of the Milsertor Service Centre are clad with folding sunscreens, which pick the banded pattern of the main facade. The folding elements are made of 6mm white panels that diffuse light into the interiors when closed, creating pleasantly soft light in the offices. When the folding sliding shutters are open, they extend outwards like flags, providing unblocked view of the outside. |
