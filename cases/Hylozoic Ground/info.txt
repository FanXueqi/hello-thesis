Intro:“It’s and immersive environment, it  is about  being inside  something, not  being on top of it and owning  it, but by swallowed by it, with a sense of vertigal.” -- Philip Beesley|“By questioning what the  nature of architecture could be, Hylozoic Ground proposes vivid possibilities for a renewed responsive relationship between humanity and the built environment.” -- Eric Haldenby, University of Waterloo|“...part creatures, part environments; part mechanical, part biological..” -- Detlef Mertins, University of Pennsylvania.|Hylozoic Ground, Canada’s entry to the Biennale di Venezia 12th International Architecture Exhibition, is part of a series of collaborative installations that have developed several years by researchers in different places including Toronto, Waterloo, London, and Odense. The project’s title refers to ‘hylozoism’, an ancient perception of life arising out of material. “It implies a belief in enlivening the vital force within materials,” said Neil Spiller. “ The material changes are conceived as the first stages of dependent interactions were living functions might take root within the matrix,” said Beesley.
