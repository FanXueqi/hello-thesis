Intro: “In order to solve this issue, new possibilities of shading systems must be developed which achieve a higher degree of adaptation and flexibility to adjust to complex geometries. The project Garden by the Bay in Singaporeis a successful example of an adaptive shading system applied on large-scale curved structures. Traditional blinds, although responsive and effective, would have been difficult to be applied to the two shell structures of the conservatories and could have hardly been oriented to a correct position for optimal shading [18]. In this project a retractable system has been designed in which canvas shades are positioned externally, allowing light transmission while protecting the façade from over-heating. The sensors installed in the interior spaces control temperature, light and humidity. When the recorded levels increase motors unroll two triangular shadings per element. The key feature of this device may be seen in the fact that the system is laid out on a diagrid. Because of this the two shaded surfaces of one unit are always planar because triangular and therefore may easily be retracted by rolling. As such the system can continuously adapt to the changing double curved surface it is attached to.”
