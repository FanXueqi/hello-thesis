Intro:A single-layer film facade placed in front of the building's insulation glazing protects the daylight-optimized blinds from strong wind and other weather influences.(Behnisch Architekten)|“Unlike a double facade made of glass, this construction does not require horizontal partitioning as a fire prevention measure. As a result, the air-filled space in the facade can be used for window ventilation of the building.”(MGS Architecture.)
